# 911 Dynamic Location Routing

<img src="../../images/dynamic_location_routing2.svg" style="max-width:65%">

[Dynamic Location Routing](https://support.bandwidth.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006080074-911-Dynamic-Location-Routing-integration-guide) allows you to leverage a user’s location at the time of a 911 call. Use the [Bandwidth Dashboard](https://dashboard.bandwidth.com/) to manage your locations through our portal or APIs.

When a call is placed, DLR uses the caller’s specified location. This information is then used to route the call and is made available for display at the destination Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP).
