# Rate Limits

Rate limits for MFA are based on your [Voice API Rate Limits](../voice/rateLimits.md) and [Messaging API Rate Limits](../messaging/ratelimits.md).

Additionally, rate limits apply for attempting to verifying invalid codes. Please see the `429` section under [Errors](./errors.md#http-429).
