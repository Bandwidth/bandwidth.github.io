# Administrative Functions

## Users

The users that have access for an account are accessible via a request to the users resource on the account.

## Managing User Passwords

Although at this time the set of users that can access an account is managed directly by Bandwidth Personnel, it is possible to manage the password for a user.  This function is constrained so that a user may only reset their own password, and must place the API call using those credentials.

The password has a minimum length of 6 characters and a maximum length of 20.

In the case of a lost password Bandwidth support personnel can provide a password reset.
