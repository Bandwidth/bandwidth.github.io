# Call Screening {#top}

## About {#about}
Call screening allows the original caller to record their name before forwarding the call to the final destination. When the forwarded call is answered, the recorded name is played back to the recipeint.

## Assumptions
* You have signed up for the [Bandwidth voice & messaging APIs](https://app.bandwidth.com)
* You are familiar with:
  * [Receiving incoming calls and messages](incomingCallandMessaging.md)
  * [Playing audio on a call](playAudio.md)
  * [Recording audio on a call](recordCall.md)
  * [Creating a gather request](createGather.md)
  * [Forwarding a call](https://dev.bandwidth.com/ap-docs/methods/calls/postTransferCall.html)

## Steps
1. [Receive Incoming Call and Answer event](#incomingCall-and-answer)
2. [Use the Speak Sentence method to prompt user to record their name](#speak-sentence)
3. [Receive the Speak Sentence Events](#speak-finished)
4. [Turn on Audio Recording](#turn-on-recording)
5. [Create Gather](#create-gather)
6. [Receive either gather event or timeout](#gather-complete)
7. [Turn off audio recording](#turn-off-recording)
8. [Get audio recording location](#recording-finished)
9. [Get the media location from the `recordingId`](#media-from-recordingId)
10. [Transfer the call with whisperAudio](#transfer-with-whisper)

## Receive Incoming Call and Answer event {#incomingCall-and-answer}

After setting up your [application to receive incoming calls](incomingCallandMessaging.md) with `autoAnswer` enabled. You will receive two events back to back:

1. [`incomingCall`](https://dev.bandwidth.com/ap-docs/apiCallbacks/incomingCall.html)
2. [`answer`](https://dev.bandwidth.com/ap-docs/apiCallbacks/answer.html)

Your server should reply with any `HTTP 2xx` code to acknowledge that the callback event was delivered.  Any thing returned in the response besides the status code is ignored by Bandwidth.

## Use the Speak Sentence method to prompt user to record their name {#speak-sentence}

In order to prevent the prompt from being recorded, you need to use the `playAudio` to speak a sentence before turning on recording.

For the purposes of this tutorial, we're using the text-to-speech features of the API. The same flow holds true if you wanted to use a pre-recorded message as well.

{% extendmethod %}

### Request URL

<code class="post">POST</code>`https://api.catapult.inetwork.com/v1/users/{userId}/calls/{callId}/audio`

### Basic Parameters

| Parameter | Description                                                                                        |
|:----------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| sentence  | The sentence to speak. **MAXIMUM LENGTH 1000 CHARACTERS**                                          |
| gender    | The gender of the voice used to synthesize the sentence.                                           |
| locale    | The locale used to get the accent of the voice used to synthesize the sentence.                    |
| voice     | The voice to speak the sentence.                                                                   |
| tag       | A string that will be included in the events delivered when the audio playback starts or finishes. |

{% endextendmethod %}

## Receive the Speak Sentence Events {#speak-finished}

During the speak sentence Bandwidth will send two [callbacks](https://dev.bandwidth.com/ap-docs/apiCallbacks/speak.html) with the status of the sentence:

1. `{"eventType": "speak", "status": "started"}`
2. `{"eventType": "speak", "status": "done"}`

}
```

## Turn on Audio Recording {#turn-on-recording}

Once you receive the `{ "status": "done" }` event for the sentence, you'll want to immediately turn on recording and create a gather.

{% extendmethod %}

### Request URL

<code class="post">POST</code>`https://api.catapult.inetwork.com/v1/users/{userId}/calls/{callId}`

### Basic Parameters

| Parameter           | Description                                                                           |

  "recordingEnabled": true
}
```

{% endextendmethod %}

## Create Gather {#create-gather}

This solution uses the [`gather`](https://dev.bandwidth.com/ap-docs/methods/calls/postCallsCallIdGather.html) method to allow us to specify a `interDigitTimeout` and `maxDigits: 1` so that we can stop recording easily after a specified duration has passed, -OR- the caller presses any digit.

{% extendmethod %}

### Request URL

<code class="post">POST</code>`https://api.catapult.inetwork.com/v1/users/{userId}/calls/{callId}/gather`

### Basic Parameters

| Parameter         | Description                                                                                       |
|:------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| maxDigits         | The maximum number of digits to collect, not including terminating digits (maximum 30).           |
| interDigitTimeout | Stop gathering if a DTMF digit is not detected in this many seconds (default 5.0; maximum 30.0).  |
| tag               | A string you choose that will be included with the response and events for this gather operation. |

Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Authorization: {apiToken:apiSecret}

{
  "maxDigits"         : "1",
  "interDigitTimeout" : "6"
}
```

{% endextendmethod %}

## Receive either gather event or timeout {#gather-complete}

When either the user has pressed a digit or the timeout has passed, you'll get a callback indicating as such.  Once we receive the gather event, so long as it's not a `hung-up` event we want to now turn off recording.  If the caller hangsup during the gather, the flow should end.

{% extendmethod %}

## Transfer the call with whisperAudio {#transfer-with-whisper}

The final step is to transfer the original call to the desired forwarding destination.  Using the `{ "state": "transferring" }` update to the call will allow you to specify a `whisper` to be played to the recipient before the two calls are bridged.

In this case, you'll use the `media-url` from above as the `fileUrl` within the `whisperAudio`.

### Example Transfer Call with Whisper

```http
POST https://api.catapult.inetwork.com/v1/users/{userId}/calls/{callId}/ HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Authorization: {apiToken:apiSecret}

{
  "state"            : "transferring",
  "transferCallerId" : "private",
  "transferTo"       : "+18382947878",
  "callbackUrl"      : "{{your-url}}",
  "whisperAudio"     : {
    "fileUrl" : "{{mediaUrl-from-above}}"
  }
}
```

{% endextendmethod %}

## Wrapping it up

Once the original inbound call has been updated with the `{ "state": "transferring" }` to transfer the call, Bandwidth will play a default ringing to the inbound call while the call is transferred. When the final destination answers the call and the whisper is finished, the two will be bridged together.
