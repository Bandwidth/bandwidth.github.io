Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
    "from"             : "{fromNumber}",
    "to"               : "{toNumber}",
    "recordingEnabled" : "true"
}
```

### How to start recording on an active call [active call](https://dev.bandwidth.com/ap-docs/methods/calls/postCallsCallId.html)

### How to stop recording on an active call [active call](https://dev.bandwidth.com/ap-docs/methods/calls/postCallsCallId.html)
