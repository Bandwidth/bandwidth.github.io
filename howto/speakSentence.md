In order to speak a sentence on a call, the call must be answered. When the call is answered, Bandwidth will notify the callbackUrl with an eventType = "answer". Once we receive this callback, we can procede with speak sentence.

### Example of callback answer event

json response

```http
POST /your_url HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
User-Agent: BandwidthAPI/v1

{
    "eventType" : "answer",
    "from"      : "{toNumber}",
    "to"        : "{fromNumber}",
    "callId"    : "{callId}",
    "callUri"   : "{callUri}",
    "callState" : "active",
    "time"      : "date"
