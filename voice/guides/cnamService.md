# CNAM Service

Bandwidthâ€™s Caller Name (CNAM) service is a low-cost per-query service that provides the Caller Name on VoIP calls in the US and Canada.

With this service, the CNAM database is queried using a simple HTTPS GET Request.
Once the request is made, the calling name is returned to the customer application or dial plan.

The CNAM data is managed by the phone company who provides the phone numbers to its customers.
