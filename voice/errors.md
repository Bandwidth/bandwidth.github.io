# Errors during an active call {#top}
Errors that occur during an active call will be delivered to the `disconnectUrl` for outbound calls and `Call status callback URL` for inbound calls in the form of a [Disconnect](bxml/callbacks/disconnect.md) event.  Example errors:
* Invalid BXML returned by a callback
* Unable to reach the callback url
* Callback URL returns a 4XX or 5XX response code
* User rate limits are reached
* System rate limits are reached

Errors can also be found for a specific call by [querying the call data in the API](methods/calls/getCallsCallId.md).
