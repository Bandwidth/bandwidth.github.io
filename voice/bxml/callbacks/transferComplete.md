##  Transfer Complete Event â€“ <Transfer> verb
This event is sent to the `transferCompleteUrl` of the A-leg's `<Transfer>` verb when the transferred call (B-leg) completes.
In a simultaneous ringing scenario, only one B-leg succeeds and this event corresponds to that successful leg. If none of the calls were answered, the `transferComplete` event is not sent.
