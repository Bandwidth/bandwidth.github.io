##  Transfer Answer Event â€“ <Transfer> verb
When processing a `<Transfer>` verb, this event is sent when a called party (B-leg) answers.  The event is sent to
  the endpoint specified in the `transferAnswerUrl` attribute of the `<PhoneNumber>` tag that answered.  `<PlayAudio>` and/or `<SpeakSentence>` verbs returned by this callback will be
  executed for the called party only.  No other BXML verbs may be specified.  At the conclusion of the BXML, the called party will be bridged to the original
  call.
