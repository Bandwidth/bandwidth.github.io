##  Transfer Answer Event â€“ <Transfer> verb
When processing a [`<Transfer>`](../verbs/transfer.md) verb, this event is sent when a called party (B-leg) answers.  The event is sent to
  the endpoint specified in the `transferAnswerUrl` attribute of the `<PhoneNumber>` tag that answered. Verbs returned by this callback will be
  executed for the called party only. Afterward, the called party will be bridged to the original
  call. Allowed verbs are [Gather](../verbs/gather.md), [Hangup](../verbs/hangup.md), [Pause](../verbs/pause.md),
  [PauseRecording](../verbs/pauseRecording.md), [PlayAudio](../verbs/playAudio.md), [Record](../verbs/record.md), 
  [Redirect](../verbs/redirect.md), [ResumeRecording](../verbs/resumeRecording.md), [SendDtmf](../verbs/sendDtmf.md), 
  [SpeakSentence](../verbs/speakSentence.md), [StartRecording](../verbs/startRecording.md), and [StopRecording](../verbs/stopRecording.md). 
  Verbs not allowed during this event are [Conference](../verbs/conference.md), [Forward](../verbs/forward.md), and [Transfer](../verbs/transfer.md).
  
  
  It is important to note that no other BXML verbs may be specified after a Transfer Answer Event is called.
