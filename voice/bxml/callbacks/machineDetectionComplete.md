- `answering-machine`: an answering-machine was detected; the `speechThreshold` and `speechEndThreshold` parameters can be used to tweak the speech detection operation.
- `silence`: no speech was detected; the `silenceTimeout` parameter can be used to control the period.
- `timeout`: no result was determined; the `detectionTimeout` parameter can be used to control the period.
- `error`: an error ocurred during the machine detection operation.
