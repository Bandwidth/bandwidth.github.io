##  Machine Detection Complete Event

This event is sent to the url informed when requesting a machine detection operation. This event isn't sent when sync answering machine detection mode is chosen. It contains the machine detection operation result, which can be:
- `human`: a human was detected; the `speechThreshold` and `speechEndThreshold` parameters can be used to tweak the speech detection operation.
- `answering-machine`: an answering-machine was detected; the `speechThreshold` and `speechEndThreshold` parameters can be used to tweak the speech detection operation.
- `silence`: no speech was detected; the `silenceTimeout` parameter can be used to control the period.
- `timeout`: no result was determined; the `detectionTimeout` parameter can be used to control the period.
- `error`: an error ocurred during the machine detection operation.

To modify the call after receiving this callback, your application should sent a request to the [Update Calls](../../methods/calls/postCallsCallId.md) endpoint.
