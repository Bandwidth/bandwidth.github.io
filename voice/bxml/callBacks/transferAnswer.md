##  Transfer Answer Event â€“ <Transfer> verb
When processing a `<Transfer>` verb, this event is sent when a called party (B-leg) answers.  The event is sent to
  the endpoint specified in the `transferAnswerUrl` attribute of the `<PhoneNumber>` tag that answered.  BXML returned by this callback will be
  executed for the called party only.  At the conclusion of the BXML, the called party will be bridged to the original
  call.
